# Performance Report
- The folllowing is a report on the performance of the deep learning model I created for Alphabet Soup.
## Overview of the analysis:
- 
## Results:
- Data Preprocessing
    - What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
    - What variable(s) are the features for your model?
    - What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
    - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
    - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    - What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
